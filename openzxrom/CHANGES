OpenZXRom 2008-xx-xx
- Additional keyboard scanning / decoding routines: 'key_test' @ 0x031e and
  'key_code' @ 0x0333. Called from interrupt routine, so programs which poll
  'last_key' system variable will now respond to keypresses
- 'cmd_ink', 'cmd_paper' and 'putchar' routines support INK/PAPER 8
  (transparent) and 9 (contrast)
- FLASH and BRIGHT commands implemented ('cmd_flash' / 'cmd_bright'), and
  'putchar' updated to support FLASH/BRIGHT 8 (transparent)
- Bugfix: PRINT TAB x no longer moves to the next line if cursor is already at
  position x. (Also affected PRINT AT y,0)

OpenZXRom 2007-12-31
- Routine to allocate arbitrary space in memory ('alloc_space')
- LOAD command implemented ('cmd_load') (except DATA)
- 'cmd_border' moved to 0x2298 to provide 'set_border' entry point at 0x229b
  (used by various Jonathan Cauldwell games)
- Character printing supports comma control (CHR$ 6)
- Character printing supports flash / bright controls (CHR$ 18 and 19)
- Character printing supports user-defined graphics
- Implemented 'border_colour' system variable to preserve border colour after
  tape loading
- Fatal errors now output diagnostic messages
- Bugfix: parameter to CLEAR is not lost during call to clear_screen
- Bugfix: 'consume' (RST 0x0020) no longer wraps interp_ptr at 256b boundaries
- Bugfix: 'skip_whitespace' now gets parameterless and one-parameter control
  codes the right way round
- Bugfix: IM1 interrupt service routine doesn't screw with flags
- Bugfix: 'get_string_expr' logic reversed to not reject string expressions
- Bugfix: 'skip_whitespace' does not skip over byte 0x0e (allowing a
  parameterless BIN to be consumed)

- calc_pop_bc and calc_pop_a now handle floating point values
- RPN calculator mode put in place ('calc' @ 0x0028), although only a limited
  number of commands are supported at present
- Expression parser (was 'get_num_expr', now 'get_expr') extended to work with
  both string and numeric expressions
- PEEK and IN functions implemented ('func_peek' / 'func_in')
- POKE and OUT commands implemented ('cmd_poke' / 'cmd_out')
- USR (numeric) function implemeted ('func_usr')
- PLOT command implemented ('cmd_plot', plus entry points 'pixel_addr'
  and 'plot_bc')
- Changed system font to Clairsys by Paul van der Laan
  <http://www.type-invaders.com/>
- Source now split into multiple files for easier maintenance

OpenZXRom 2006-06-18
- Basic interpreter core ('interp')
- Numeric expression parsing ('get_num_expr'); can process nearly all syntax
  (with the sole exception of string comparisons), although only literal
  numerics can actually be evaluated at the moment
- Rudimentary calculator stack operations ('calc_pop_aedcb' @ 0x2bf1,
  'calc_pop_a' @ 0x2dd5)
- INK and PAPER commands implemented ('cmd_ink' / 'cmd_paper')
- BORDER command implemented ('cmd_border')
- NEW command implemented ('cmd_new')
- CLS command implemented ('cmd_cls')
- REM command implemented ('cmd_rem')
- GO TO command implemented ('cmd_goto')
- RUN command implemented ('cmd_run')
- STOP command implemented ('cmd_stop')
- RANDOMIZE command implemented ('cmd_randomize')
- CLEAR command implemented ('cmd_clear')
- Auto-running programs on LOAD
- Error reporting framework ('error' @ 0x0008)
- System variables vars_addr, calc_stack_end (was spare_mem_addr) moved to
  correct ZX ROM compatible locations

OpenZXRom 2006-06-03
- Tape loading (0x0556)
- Slightly redesigned splash screen, and moved to separate file for easier
  version number bumping

OpenZXRom 2006-05-17
- Key scanning routine (0x028e)
- IM1 interrupt service routine updates FRAMES system variable
- Print-string routine now ZX ROM compatible (0x203c)
- Character printing now respects setting of font system variable
- Character printing preserves registers
- perm_attribute and temp_attribute system variables moved to match ZX ROM
- New entry point for clear_screen (0x0daf)

OpenZXRom 2006-04-10
- Initial release
- Character printing, splash screen, screen clearing, font
- Not much else...
