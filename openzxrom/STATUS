User entry points
-----------------
These are addresses which it is anticipated that user programs will attempt to
call; we therefore attempt to match the documented behaviour of the equivalent
routines in the ZX ROM.

0x0000: Startup

0x0008: Error display
	Only a limited number of error messages are available.

0x0010: Print a character
	Character classes supported: Newline (0x0d), INK/PAPER controls (except
	pseudo-colours 8 and 9), AT and TAB controls, standard characters (0x20-0x7f;
	includes customised fonts).
	Not supported: Comma control, cursor / backspace controls, FLASH / BRIGHT
	controls, INVERSE / OVER controls, block graphics, user-defined graphics,
	keyword tokens.
	Does not handle scrolling upon reaching the bottom of the screen.

0x0028: Calculator mode
	Calculator opcodes supported: 0x2b (PEEK), 0x2c (IN), 0x2d (USR num)

0x0038: IM1 interrupt service routine
	Updates FRAMES system variable; no keyboard scanning.

0x028e: Keyboard scanning

0x0556: Load bytes from tape
	LOAD only, no VERIFY. Other addresses synchronised with ZX ROM behaviour are
	0x0565 (entry point as trapped by FUSE for tape flash-loading) and 0x05e2
	(return address from FUSE flash-loading).
	
0x0d6b: Clear screen
	0x0daf is another valid entry point.
	
0x1601: Open stream
	Often used to ensure that RST 0x0010 output is directed to the upper screen;
	this is currently the only supported output mode, so this routine is a no-op.

0x203c: Print a string

0x22aa: Translate coordinates to screen address

0x22e5: Plot a pixel
	Does not account for attributes or INVERSE / OVER state

0x2ab6: PUSH contents of AEDCB to calculator stack

0x2bf1: POP value from calculator stack into AEDCB

0x2d28: PUSH contents of A to calculator stack

0x2d2b: PUSH contents of BC to calculator stack

0x2da2: POP value from calculator stack into BC

0x2dd5: POP value from calculator stack into A

Expression support
------------------
	Numeric literals - supported
	String literals - supported
	Bracketed expressions - supported
	Variables - not supported
	Array subscripts - not supported
	Operators:
		Boolean (OR , AND , NOT) - parsed but not evaluated
		Numeric comparison ( = , < , > , <> , <= , >= ) - parsed but not evaluated
		String comparison ( = , < , > , <> , <= , >= ) - parsed but not evaluated
		String concatenation (+) - parsed but not evaluated
		Arithmetic ( + , - , * , / , ^ ) - unary '+' trivially skipped over, others
			parsed but not evaluated
		Functions:
			IN, PEEK, USR (numeric)
		  Others parsed but not evaluated (arguments not parsed)
